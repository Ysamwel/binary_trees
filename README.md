**Introduction**
Binary trees are widely used in computer science for various purposes such as organizing data efficiently, implementing search algorithms, and representing hierarchical structures. This project provides a simple implementation of a binary tree in Python, along with basic operations for insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

**Features**
Creation of binary trees with arbitrary data.
Insertion of nodes into the binary tree.
Deletion of nodes from the binary tree.
Traversal of the binary tree using various methods (inorder, preorder, postorder).
Searching for a specific value within the binary tree.
